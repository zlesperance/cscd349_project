##Ideas:

* Weapon Upgrading: Chance to break or 100%?
* open map with no exit or multiple floors?
* automatic input detection?
* skills / abilities?
* DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE !!
* character types
* monster types
* critical hits?
* how many gears / items?
* hunger system?
* sleep system?
* different places on the map could have bonuses, armor increase, health increase, etc
* heros/monsters could have a set of unique abilities
* every time fight a monster, as game progresses, monsters get harder
* leveling system?
